# Castiel

Castiel allows you to discover and control Chromecast devices on your network.

Built to enable users to more easily use their Chromecasts as displays for
dashboards, Castiel presents a web interface which shows a list of available
Chromecast devices. You can then send videos, pictures, and webpages to those
Chromecasts to be displayed.

Castiel is perfect for users who wish they could display Grafana dashboards or
static images on a TV.
