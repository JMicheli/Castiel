# Boardcast

Boardcast allows you to discover and control Chromecast devices on your network.

Built to enable users to more easily use their Chromecasts as displays for
dashboards, Boardcast presents a web interface which shows a list of available
Chromecast devices. You can then send videos, pictures, and webpages to those
Chromecasts to be displayed.

Boardcast is perfect for users who wish they could display Grafana dashboards or
static images on a TV.

## TODO List

- Put running app and stop button at frontpage
- For docker
  - Can I just forward the correct MDNS ports for a docker container?
  - MDNS blast is a UDP thing so probably need to forward those ports.
