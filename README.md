# Castiel

Castiel allows you to discover and control Chromecast devices on your network.

Built to enable users to more easily use their Chromecasts as displays for
dashboards, Castiel presents a web interface which shows a list of available
Chromecast devices. You can then send videos, pictures, and webpages to those
Chromecasts to be displayed.

Castiel is perfect for users who wish they could display Grafana dashboards or
static images on a TV.

## Development

The current version of the application is able to control starting and stopping
media on Chromecast devices on your network, but Castiel is still under active
development. Future updates may significantly change the layout and
functionality of the application.

If there are any bugs you discover, please open an issue. Contributors welcome!
